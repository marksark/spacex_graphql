# A SpaceX API Search using GraphQL, Apollo, and React
This app allows a user to search SpaceX launches. It supports filtering by Mission Name, Rocket Name, or Launch Year

## Development
Clone the repo and follow the instructions below to begin local development

### Backend (Server)
From the root directory of the app
```bash
cd server
npm install
# To begin running the backend on port 5000, use
npm run server
```

### Frontend (Client)
From the root directory of the app

```bash
cd client
npm install
# To begin the frontend of this app on port 3000, use
npm run start
```

#### Other Notes
- This app currently has a separate backend and frontend, so you will need at least 2 terminal tabs open for now (alternatively, you can use run-p or concurrently to run them at the same time)
- I am not ~~a cat~~ a graphql wizard, and this app is my first crack at it
- Feel free to clone this app for your own project, log any issues (or fix them yourself and submit a PR) :)
